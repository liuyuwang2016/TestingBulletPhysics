// NOTE
// Three extra steps were taken to configure this project:
//   1) The BulletSoftBody project was included
//	 2) The above project was set as a dependency
//   3) BulletSoftBody_vs2010_debug.lib was added to the list of required .lib files (Linker->Input->Additional Dependencies).
// All of the above are required for the simulation of soft bodies.

#include "BulletOpenGLApplication.h"

// includes required for soft body simulation

#include "BulletSoftBody/btSoftBodyRigidBodyCollisionConfiguration.h"
